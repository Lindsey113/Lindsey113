## Hi there 👋

My name is Lindsey, and I am a full-stack web developer (in training!)

I am currently learning how to manipulate JS, CSS & HTML into works of art, and I am so excited to share them with you!

Here's a few fun facts about me:

- I am currently an Ophthalmic Technician in British Columbia, Canada 🍁
- I am a crazy cat lady (who only has one cat, but planning on changing that as soon as possible)
- My favorite place in the world is Doolin, Ireland
